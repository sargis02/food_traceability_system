# Sharing My Independent University, bangladesh DBMS Project: Food Traceability System (Work in Progress) ðŸš€

Excited to showcase my Database Management System (DBMS) projectâ€”a Food Traceability System built during my semester! While the full implementation wasnâ€™t completed due to time constraints, this project gave me hands-on experience with core database concepts and web development.

ðŸ”¹ What I Built:
âœ” Frontend: Interactive UI with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
âœ” Backend: PHP for server-side logic
âœ” Database: Designed and implemented relational tables in MySQL (via XAMPP)
âœ” Tools: Developed in VS Code with XAMPP for local hosting

ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings:
ðŸ“Œ ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams): Structured database design for food supply chains.
ðŸ“Œ Schema Normalization: Optimized tables to reduce redundancy.
ðŸ“Œ Rich Picture Modeling: Mapped stakeholder interactions visually.
ðŸ“Œ PHP-MySQL Integration: Connected dynamic web forms to the database.

Though unfinished, this project deepened my understanding of real-world DBMS challengesâ€”from query optimization to user-role management. Iâ€™d love feedback or suggestions for future improvements!
